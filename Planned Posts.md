# Planned posts/interactives

## Posts
1. Creation of physics simulator
2. Evolution of creatures using a genetic algorithm
3. Series: the creation of MathGraph3D
   * ~~Managing 3D Space~~ [Completed](http://sambrunacini.com/creation-of-mathgraph3d-part-1-foundation/)
   * ~~Surface smoothing, clipping, discontinuity handling, and more~~ [Completed](http://sambrunacini.com/creation-of-mathgraph3d-part-2-surface-algorithms/)
   * Parametric plots and graphing 4D complex-valued functions
   * Implicit plots: marching squares
   * ~~Coloring and lighting megapost~~ [Completed](http://sambrunacini.com/creation-of-mathgraph3d-part-3-coloring-and-lighting/)
4. Maybe the directed line plotter thing but meh
5. raycasting "AI" navigator but meh
6. perhaps do the desmos collection posts more frequently as they are obviously the most popular


## Interactives
1. Canon projectile launcher / building destroyer (using the physics simulator)
2. ~~Programmable car~~ [Completed](http://plotter.sambrunacini.com/ProgrammableCar/)
3. Web version of the real time 4D canvas complex plotter
4. Charge/magnetism field visualizer
5. Crossy road spinoff
6. VectorGraph2D
7. ContourMG3
